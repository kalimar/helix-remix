### Helix Remix this Week
(In descending view count order)

The background music is brought to you by John Nathan Cordy's Helix Native Improvisations (which is featured in this countdown!)

* [No Longer Slaves - Bethel Music - Electric guitar cover // Line 6 Helix patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0aisjMqYxU) - Demos the patch for the guitar parts, and talks a little about the guitar used in the recording.
* [Helix Stock Cabs vs. Impulse Responses with BLIND TEST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGmhuRjmYk) - I learned a lot about Helix cab simulation vs impulse responses in this video. Jason walks through how he setup the comparison and then provides tips and tricks for dialing in tones with stock cabs.
* [Line 6 Helix Diezel VH4 Mega Amp is Sick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuJ-QdX5JWA) - Cool video with John Cordy soloing using the [Diezel VH4 Mega Amp](https://www.fluidsolo.com/patchexchange/view-model/Das-Benzin-Mega,39). At 2:40s he stops soloing and lets his backing track play so you can jam along.
* [Neural DSP Quad Cortex vs. Fractal Audio Axe Fx3 vs Line6 Helix ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Pnc0frASI) - Sebastian compares the three kings of amp modelling. **Spoiler alert!!!** - they don't sound drastically different, boils down to your budget and user experience preferences.
* [Line 6 Helix Native Improvisations - A total BARGAIN tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLA3vxLomng) - Listen to 8 minutes of amazing improvising using Helix Native. If you're not familiar Helix Native is a DAW plugin with the same look and feel as HX Edit and gives you all of the sounds found in Helix or HX stomp.
* [How to Prepare Your HELIX for a GIG - Tips and Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBJObfwlLE) - How to get ready for a gig with Helix!
* [Line 6 HX Stomp XL (y firmware de Helix 3.1), el análisis completo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glHhGGh9w14) - Para neustros amigos latinos, a thorough review of the HX Stomp XL. 
* [Line 6 Helix & HX Stomp Vintage Clean Tone- NO GUITAR AMP + HX Stomp GIVEAWAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NKicz_9vtE) - Steve Sterlacci talks about launching his [new website](https://stevesterlacci.com) and the big give away sponsored by Line 6. Then walked us through how he dialed in a preset inspired by Motown using no amp or cab. They were known for recording directly into the mixing console so this was pretty interesting. 


* [Free Patch for Tom Petty Helix/Variax tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrHZ-95OeIA) - link in the description to the Helix Patch. Sounds pretty rad!

* [Line 6 Helix - Going BACK IN TIME to the FIRST FIRMWARE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMc8F2RcTs) - John Cordy flashback - when he first got his hands on the Helix. Great for anyone who is interested in learning more about the flagship Helix Floor Unit. Some funny overdubbed comments

I have a few more links in the description below that are worth noting but we ran out of time to discuss here:
* [When you Wish Upon a Star - Gibson ES165 Herb Ellis and Line 6 Helix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIHHlyFkL1k)
* [Innuendo Queen using line 6 Helix looper.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXb4xl0LcWs) - Impressive!
* [Line 6 Helix - Acoustic Guitar Preset - With IR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC9eZ3bSimA)
* [Line 6 Helix Native Improvisations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLA3vxLomng) - John Cordy again, this time recording with Helix Native, the DAW plugin. Some lovely sounds.




### Patch of the Week

I purchased my HX Stomp only about a month ago so to learn more about it I'm going to feature a patch from each amp for the next several weeks. So first up is the WhoWatt 100, which is based on the Hiwatt® DR-103 Brill. You heard it in the intro music, and in the background right now. This is a patch from the Fluid Solo Patch Exchange (link below) created by the user Jorge, who also happens to be the maintainer of this amazing website. I've included links to the [patch](https://www.fluidsolo.com/patchexchange/patch/pink-floyd-comfortably-numb,71) and more about the [ampsim](https://www.fluidsolo.com/patchexchange/view-model/Whowatt-100,79).
