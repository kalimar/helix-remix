### Helix Remix this Week
* [Helix Stock Cabs vs. Impulse Responses with BLIND TEST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGmhuRjmYk) - I learned a lot about Helix cab simulation vs impulse responses in this video. Jason walks through how he setup the comparison and then provides tips and tricks for dialing in tones with stock cabs.
* [Line 6 HX Stomp XL (y firmware de Helix 3.1), el análisis completo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glHhGGh9w14) - Para neustros amigos latinos, a thorough review of the HX Stomp XL. 
* [Line 6 Helix & HX Stomp Vintage Clean Tone- NO GUITAR AMP + HX Stomp GIVEAWAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NKicz_9vtE) - Steve Starlacci talks about launching his [new website](https://stevesterlacci.com) and the big give away sponsored by Line 6. Then walked us through how he dialed in a preset inspired by Motown using no amp or cab. They were known for recording directly into the mixing console so this was pretty interesting. 
* [Line 6 Helix Diezel VH4 Mega Amp is Sick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuJ-QdX5JWA) - Cool video with John Cordy soloing using the [Diezel VH4 Mega Amp](https://www.fluidsolo.com/patchexchange/view-model/Das-Benzin-Mega,39). At 2:40s he stops soloing and lets his backing track play so you can jam along.
* [Line 6 Helix Native Improvisations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLA3vxLomng) - John Cordy again, this time recording with Helix Native, the DAW plugin. Some lovely sounds.
* [Line 6 Helix - Going BACK IN TIME to the FIRST FIRMWARE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDMc8F2RcTs) - John Cordy flashback - when he first got his hands on the Helix. Great for anyone who is interested in learning more about the flagship Helix Floor Unit.
* [Neural DSP Quad Cortex vs. Fractal Audio Axe Fx3 vs Line6 Helix ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Pnc0frASI) - Sebastian compares the three kings of amp modelling. **Spoiler alert!!!** - they don't sound drastically different, boils down to your budget and user experience preferences.

### Patch of the Week

I purchased my HX Stomp only about a month ago so to learn more about it I'm going to feature a patch from each amp for the next several weeks. So first up is the WhoWatt 100, which is based on the Hiwatt® DR-103 Brill. You heard it in the intro music, and in the background right now. This is a patch from the Fluid Solo Patch Exchange (link below) created by the user Jorge, who also happens to be the maintainer of this amazing website. I've included links to the [patch](https://www.fluidsolo.com/patchexchange/patch/pink-floyd-comfortably-numb,71) and more about the [ampsim](https://www.fluidsolo.com/patchexchange/view-model/Whowatt-100,79).
